            <h2>About the American Crow</h2>
            <p>The <strong>American crow</strong> (<strong><em>Corvus brachyrhynchos</em></strong>) is a large passerine
                bird species of the family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corvidae">Corvidae</a>. It is a common 
                bird found throughout much of North America. American crows are the New World counterpart to the carrion 
                crow of Europe and the hooded crow of Eurasia; they all occupy the same ecological niche. Although the 
                American crow and the hooded crow are very similar in size, structure and behavior, their calls and 
                visual appearance are different.<br /> <br />From beak to tail, an American crow measures 40–50 cm 
                (16–20 in), almost half of which is tail. Plumage is all black, with iridescent feathers. They are very 
                intelligent, and adaptable to human environments. The most usual call is 
                CaaW!-CaaW!-CaaW!. <br /><br /> American crows are common, 
                widespread, and susceptible to the West Nile virus, making them useful as a bioindicator to track the 
                virus's spread. Direct transmission of the virus from crows to humans is impossible. They are considered 
                an agricultural pest, and are subject to hunting and management.</p>
