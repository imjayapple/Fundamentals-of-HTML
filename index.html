The below declaration is an instruction which tells the browser which HTML is being used
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- The below html tags begin the foundation of HTML structure. Anything between the opening and closing
tags will be interpreted as HTML code -->

<html>
    <head>
        <!-- Here in the head section contains all of the webpages' metadata, metadata = data about data -->
        <!-- Use the title opening and closing tags to give the webpage a title  -->
    </head>

    <body>
        <!-- This body section contains the main content of the webpage -->
    </body>
</html>

<!-- Open a link in a new tab by setting the target to "_blank" -->

<!-- Linking to relative pages requires an understanding of where HTML files are stored locally, relative paths
begin with "./" which tells the browser to look for the file in the current folder, as opposed to providing the
browswer with the absolute path -->

|- contact.html
|- index.html

<!-- Link to a target on the same page by first providing it with an id -->
<!-- Then use the # character and the targets element's id -->
<p id="top">This is the top of the page!</p>
<h1 id="bottom">This is the bottom!</h1>

<ol>
    <li><a href="#top">Top</a></li>

</ol>

<!-- Proper indentation and whitespace, both render the same, but one is more human-friendly than the other -->
<body><p>Paragraph 1</p><p>Paragraph 2</p></body>

<body>
    <p>Paragraph 1</p>
    <p>Paragraph 2</p>
</body>

<!-- will both render as...
Paragraph 1
Paragraph 2
... with an obvious advantage in readability going to the ladder example-->

<!-- Tables contain rows, columns and individual units called cells that will hold data -->
<table>
    <tr>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    </tr>
</table>

<!-- 
Tables without titles don't make much sense to describe the data contained within, so, the table heading element is used
-->
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Monday</th>
    </tr>
</table>

<!-- The border attribute for tables has long been deprecated but it can still be seen out in the wild, use CSS to style
your tables instead -->

<!-- Data can span across multiple columns with the colspan attribute. Set it with an integer greater than 1 and it will
span across multiple sections -->

<!-- EX. This would be useful for a calendar table in which a user wants the "Out of town" message to read
across multiple days -->

<!-- Sectioning off table headings and table bodys to increase readability -->
